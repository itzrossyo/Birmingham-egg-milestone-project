## Design

### Colour Scheme

![Birmingham Egg Website Colour Palette](assets/readme-images/color-scheme.png)

The website uses a palette of pastel colours that are often used in the Birmingham Eggs images. The colour palette was created using
the [Colors](https://coolors.co/) website.

- The main color for the footer and nav bar throughout the website. - #D57b65 ![#D57b65](https://placehold.co/15x15/D57b65/D57b65.png)

- The main color that was used throughout the website background. - #fdf2ee ![#fdf2ee](https://placehold.co/15x15/fdf2ee/fdf2ee.png)
- For the contact form I went with the color. - #6aa2aa ![#6aa2aa](https://placehold.co/15x15/6aa2aa/6aa2aa.png)
- To make the dropdown menu stand out when on mobile I went for something a little darker -
  #7a7373 ![#7a7373](https://placehold.co/15x15/7a7373/7a7373.png)

### Typography

Google Fonts was used for the following fonts:

    - A responsive navigation bar at the top which allows the user to navigate through the site. To the left of the navigation bar is a slogan of
      birmingham eggs moto. in the center of the navigation bar are the links to the websites pages (home, products, about us and contact). To allow a
      good user experience of the site, the links are hidden with a media query on mobile devices to prevent the navigation bar looking cluttered.
      When viewing with mobile devices the navigation links change to a burger toggle. This was implemented to give the site a clean look and to
      promote a good user experience, as users are used to seeing the burger icon when on mobile devices to navigate a site.

### Accessibility

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. I have achieved this by:

- Using semantic HTML.
- Using descriptive alt attributes on images on the site.
- Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.
- Ensuring menus are accessible by marking the current page as current for screen readers.

### Lighthouse

I used Lighthouse within the Chrome Developer Tools to allow me to test the performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO of the website.

#### Index Page

Initial lighthouse testing :
![Lighthouse Testing for Desktop Index Page - Test 1](assets/readme-images/lighthouse-score-desktop.png)

![Lighthouse Testing for Mobile Index Page - Test 1](assets/readme-images/lighthouse-mobile.png)

Suggestions:
Desktop:

1. Image elements do not have explicit width and height
2. Page prevented back/forward cache restoration 1 failure reason
3. Background and foreground colors do not have a sufficient contrast ratio.
   Final lighthouse testing:
4. Document does not have a meta description

Suggestions:
Mobile:

1.List items li are not contained within ul, ol or menu parent elements.

Pre final lighthouse testing:

After sorting out some of the accessibility out I was able to improve my score.

#### Disclaimer

- As this was a real life project for a company and I will be building off this with new features.

- There is now no audio or video was placed onto website or pages.

- I am importing css into one css stylesheet.

- The popup window will only show up if the user clicks onto the contact button for call us or email.

- On the home page, there is no hamburger menu button due to the client wanting to make sure people know where to click for more information.
