## Design

### Colour Scheme

![Birmingham Egg Website Colour Palette](/Assets/readme-images/color%20pallet.png)

The website uses a palette of pastel colours that are often used in the Birmingham Eggs images. The colour palette was created using the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) website.

### Typography

Google Fonts was used for the following fonts:

-   Roboto is used through outsite. with a full back ans-serif.

### Imagery

The member images were used with the permission of their owners from Birmingham Egg.

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created for mobile, tablet and desktop.

[Home Page Wireframe](Assets/readme-images/Homepage-desktop.png)

[Products page Wireframe](/Assets/readme-images/Products-desktop.png)

[About Us Wireframe](/Assets/readme-images/About%20Us-desktop.png)

### Features

The website is comprised of 9 pages, all are accessible from the navigation menu (home page, products page, about us page & contact us page). The 5 other page is a is shown once a user is on the product page and then they are able to select other products to filter out.

-   All Pages on the website have:

    -   A responsive navigation bar at the top which allows the user to navigate through the site. To the left of the navigation bar is an slogan of birmingham eggs moto. in the center of the navigation bar are the links to the websites pages (home, products, about us and contact). To allow a good user experience of the site, the links are hidden with a media query on mobile devices to prevent the navigation bar looking cluttered. When viewing with mobile devices the navigation links change to a burger toggler. This was implemented to give the site a clean look and to promote a good user experience, as users are used to seeing the burger icon when on mobile devices to navigate a site.

    -   A footer which contains the copyright information for the company

-   Home Page.

    -   what are brimgingham egg main features .

-   Contact Us Page.

    -   Form
        The form contains fields for the users name, email address and checkboxes giving a reason for contact and a text area for the user to add further information. The user submits the form using the submit button. Users must fill in the name, email and text area fields to be able to submit the form. If they don't a tooltip will guide them to fill in any information they have missed.

### Accessibility

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. I have achieved this by:

-   Using semantic HTML.
-   Using descriptive alt attributes on images on the site.
-   Providing information for screen readers where there are icons used and no text - such as the review ratings for books & footer icons.
-   Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.
-   Ensuring menus are accessible by marking the current page as current for screen readers.

## Testing

Testing was ongoing throughout the entire build. I utilised Chrome developer tools while building to pinpoint and troubleshoot any issues as I went along.

The following issues were raised during my mid project meeting with my mentor:

-   The Join Us section on the home page was not in alignment with the rest of the page. Padding has now been added to bring it in alignment with the rest of the pages padding.
-   There was an issue on smaller devices where the book columns were not displaying properly. This issue is documented under issue 2 in solved bugs.
-   The introduction paragraph on the books page was not aligned in style with the rest of the page. The text has now been centered.
-   The form could be submitted with only a name filled in. ~ A required attribute has been added to the email input and textarea.

### W3C Validator

The W3C validator was used to validate the HTML on all pages of the website. It was also used to validate CSS in the style.css file.
