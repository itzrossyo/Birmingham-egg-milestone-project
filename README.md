## Design

### Colour Scheme

![Birmingham Egg Website Colour Palette](assets/readme-images/color-scheme.png)

The website uses a palette of pastel colours that are often used in the Birmingham Eggs images. The colour palette was created using the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) website.

- The main color for the footer and nav bar through out the website. - #D57b65 ![#D57b65](https://placehold.co/15x15/D57b65/D57b65.png)

- For the contact form I went with the color. - #6aa2aa ![#6aa2aa](https://placehold.co/15x15/6aa2aa/6aa2aa.png)
- To make the dropdown menu stand out wehn on mobile I went for something a little darker - #7a7373 ![#7a7373](https://placehold.co/15x15/7a7373/7a7373.png)

### Features

The website is comprised of 9 pages, all are accessible from the navigation menu (home page, products page, about us page & contact us page). The 5 other page is a is shown once a user is on the product page and then they are able to select other products to filter out.

- All Pages on the website have:

  - A responsive navigation bar at the top which allows the user to navigate through the site. To the left of the navigation bar is an slogan of birmingham eggs moto. in the center of the navigation bar are the links to the websites pages (home, products, about us and contact). To allow a good user experience of the site, the links are hidden with a media query on mobile devices to prevent the navigation bar looking cluttered. When viewing with mobile devices the navigation links change to a burger toggler. This was implemented to give the site a clean look and to promote a good user experience, as users are used to seeing the burger icon when on mobile devices to navigate a site.

  - A footer which contains the copyright information for the company

### Accessibility

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. I have achieved this by:

- Using semantic HTML.
- Using descriptive alt attributes on images on the site.
- Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.
- Ensuring menus are accessible by marking the current page as current for screen readers.

I used Lighthouse within the Chrome Developer Tools to allow me to test the performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO of the website.

#### Index Page

Initial lighthouse testing :
![Lighthouse Testing for Desktop Index Page - Test 1](assets/readme-images/lighthouse-score-desktop.png)

3. Background and foreground colors do not have a sufficient contrast ratio.
   Final lighthouse testing:
4. Document does not have a meta description

Suggestions:
Mobile:

1.List items li are not contained within ul, ol or menu parent elements.
